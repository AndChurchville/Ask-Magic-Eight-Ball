# Hello Magic Eight Ball 
## Work in Progress

My favorite hobby is drawing and art in general. I love drawing portraits and creating characters. Especially weird ones. Honestly there was a time I wanted to be a character designer. One character I usually draw is a human character with a magic eight ball for a head. 

So I decided to practice my front-end and illustration skills by creating this simple fortune telling app.
